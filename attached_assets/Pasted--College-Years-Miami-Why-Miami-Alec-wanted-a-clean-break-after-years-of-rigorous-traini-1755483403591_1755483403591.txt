🎓 College Years – Miami
	•	Why Miami?
Alec wanted a clean break after years of rigorous training and spiritual discipline under his mentor Keda in Japan. Miami offered anonymity and heat — both literal and metaphorical — and a chance to live on his own terms.
	•	Academic Focus:
Started with a major in Crime Scene Investigation, specializing in digital forensics and analytical reconstruction.
However, he quickly learned that the gore and cold sterility of autopsy work didn’t suit him. He pivoted to investigative science, focusing on:
	•	Behavioral analysis
	•	Surveillance technology
	•	Environmental forensics
	•	Graduated with a degree tailored toward federal investigative careers.

⸻

🎖️ Military Service – U.S. Army Military Police (12 Years)
	•	Initial Intent:
Enlisted for 4 years in the Military Police Corps, intending to build real-world investigative experience without starting at the bottom in local law enforcement.
	•	Actual Tenure:
Twelve years of decorated service, including tours in conflict zones and rotations in high-intensity criminal investigations.
	•	Notable Roles & Training:
	•	Attached to CID (Criminal Investigation Division) and occasionally JSOC liaison units.
	•	Specialized training in:
	•	Urban counter-threat environments
	•	Psychological operations
	•	Tactical interrogation
	•	Evidence recovery in hostile/unstable zones
	•	Close-quarters control & de-escalation
	•	Developed elite situational awareness, a calm temperament under pressure, and an ability to “read a room” with almost preternatural insight.
	•	Spiritual Anchoring:
Throughout his service, he mentally leaned on the philosophical grounding Keda gave him in Japan: focus, detachment, inner balance — all of which helped him remain unshaken in chaos.

⸻

🕵️‍♂️ Post-Military – FBI or CIA Track (Federal Training Phase)

🧪 Recruitment into AISU (Anomalous Investigation & Suppression Unit)
	•	Recruitment Timing:
During the latter half of his federal training phase, Alec’s unique psychological evaluations, military record, and resilience to abnormal stimuli raised a red flag—of interest—to people watching for specialized candidates.
	•	SAIC Elena Voss took personal interest in him. His background in:
	•	High-stakes environments
	•	Pattern disruption detection
	•	And Keda’s Eastern philosophy and discipline
…made him a candidate not just capable of surviving anomalous phenomena—but understanding and responding to them in unorthodox ways.
	•	He was quietly pulled from the mainstream recruitment path and offered a direct position with AISU, though the full scope of the unit was kept vague at first. Alec accepted—partly out of curiosity, partly because something about it felt like fate.

Summary Personality Statement

Martial Arts training

	•	He controls distance, energy, and rhythm like a skilled musician or dancer.

Symbiotic Entity: Tsukumaru (Tsuki)
Core Concept
Tsukumaru is a celestial entity bound to Alec’s soul, embodying both power and mystery. The bond is neither voluntary nor harmonious at the outset, creating a constant struggle for dominance. Their evolution reflects Alec’s journey from conflict to collaboration, with Tsukumaru’s growth paralleling Alec’s acceptance of his role and purpose.
Phases of Power and Relationship
Phase 1: Bond of Necessity (Companion Stage)
At this stage, Tsukumaru is a reluctant ally, manifesting only when Alec faces dire threats or overwhelming emotions. Its motivations are unclear, but it intervenes enough to keep Alec alive. Alec experiences its presence as a distant, aloof force with its own agenda.
Powers:
- Physical Enhancements: Tsukumaru enhances Alec’s speed, agility, and reflexes in moments of danger. - Ethereal Companion: It appears in a semi-corporeal form during battle but remains separate from Alec. Its assistance is brief and often followed by withdrawal. - Limited Communication: Tsukumaru communicates through cryptic whispers, riddles, or flashes of emotion.
Challenges:
- Alec has little control over when or how Tsukumaru manifests. - The strain of the bond leaves Alec physically and emotionally drained after Tsukumaru departs.
Phase 2: The Struggle for Dominance
In this phase, Tsukumaru takes over Alec’s body during transformations, assuming full control of their shared form. Alec exists as a voice in the background, trying to assert his influence. The balance of control shifts unpredictably, leading to moments where Alec wrestles control back or Tsukumaru suppresses his will entirely.
Powers:
- Merged Form: Alec and Tsukumaru fuse into a single entity, shifting between aspects based on the stronger will at the time:   - Predatory Aspect: A sleek, agile form optimized for speed and precision, with glowing glyph-like patterns.   - Resilient Aspect: A towering, armored form with moonlit metallic skin and massive strength.   - Spectral Aspect: A shadowy, incorporeal form capable of phasing through matter and heightened supernatural awareness. - Unpredictable Shifts: Transformations can change mid-battle if Alec or Tsukumaru seizes control. - Empathic Bond: Alec begins to feel Tsukumaru’s emotions and motivations.
Challenges:
- Loss of Agency: Alec struggles with losing control of his own body. - Internal Conflict: The fight for dominance causes dissonance in their merged form. - Emotional Strain: Alec must confront Tsukumaru’s disdain for his humanity.
Phase 3: Collaborative Unity
Alec and Tsukumaru reach a truce, aligning their wills and fighting as one. Their relationship evolves into a partnership built on mutual respect and trust. They no longer see each other as adversaries but as complementary halves of a powerful whole.
Powers:
- Perfect Harmony: Alec and Tsukumaru synchronize their movements and thoughts, achieving seamless control over their fused form. - Celestial Empowerment: They gain the ability to wield celestial energy, using moonlit beams or shadowy veils to manipulate the battlefield. - Dual Presence: Alec and Tsukumaru can briefly separate, allowing Tsukumaru to fight as an independent entity. - Shared Insight: Alec gains access to Tsukumaru’s ancient knowledge and heightened perception.
Challenges:
- Maintaining Balance: The bond requires constant effort to sustain. - Shared Vulnerability: Their lives are now intrinsically linked—if one falls, so does the other.
Personality and Communication
Personality:
- Initial Stage: Tsukumaru is proud, cold, and dismissive of Alec. - Conflict Stage: It views Alec’s attempts to influence their shared form as a challenge to its superiority. - Collaborative Stage: Tsukumaru grows to respect Alec’s resilience and humanity, becoming a loyal companion.
Communication:
- Early on, Tsukumaru communicates in cryptic riddles and flashes of emotion. - Over time, their bond deepens, and Tsukumaru’s language becomes clearer. - In moments of crisis, their voices overlap, creating a powerful, dual-toned dialogue.

	•	He worries about not fully belonging to either culture, feeling too American in Japan and too Japanese in America.

	•	This insecurity can make him hesitant to take bold steps or assert his uniqueness.

6. Fear of Losing Control

Root Cause:

Manifestation:

	•	He avoids situations where he might lose his composure, such as heated arguments or impulsive risks.

7. Claustrophobia and Confinement

Manifestation:

Example Dialog:

Alec: Derrick, we meet again. I've been digging into your dark dealings, and I won't let you get away with your crimes any longer.
Derrick: (smirking) Ah, Alec Cullum, the righteous detective with a penchant for poking into other people's affairs. What makes you think you can touch me? I have power you can't even fathom.
Alec: Power? All I see is a twisted man, clinging to a legacy of darkness. You may think you're untouchable, but justice has a way of catching up with those who hide behind their family name.
Derrick: (leaning in, eyes gleaming with malice) You underestimate the depths I'm willing to go to protect what's mine. You think you can challenge me? You have no idea what you're up against.
Alec: I've seen the darkness that resides within you, Derrick. It's time to face the consequences of your actions. Your reign of terror ends now. I won't let you continue to corrupt this city.
Derrick: (laughs) You're a naive fool, Alec. Your sense of justice won't save you. I've been pulling strings in this city long before you arrived, and I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me.
Alec: I've dealt with criminals like you before, Derrick. You may try to intimidate me, but I'm driven by a need for truth and justice. Your reign ends here, and I won't rest until you're behind bars, where you belong.
Derrick: (leaning back, a cold smirk on his face) We shall see, Alec. But remember, darkness can always find its way back. You may think you have the upper hand, but there are forces at play that you can't comprehend.
Alec: I won't back down, no matter what you throw at me. The truth will prevail, and you'll be held accountable for the pain and suffering you've caused. Mark my words, Derrick.
